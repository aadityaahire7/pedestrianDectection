In the rapidly evolving landscape of smart cities and intelligent transportation systems, ensuring pedestrian safety is paramount. With urbanization on the rise, the integration of cutting-edge technologies becomes crucial in addressing the challenges posed by increasing vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement. One such technological advancement that holds immense potential in transforming urban safety is the development of Pedestrian Detection Systems.
The Pedestrian Detection Project aims to leverage state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms to create a robust system capable of accurately identifying and tracking pedestrians in diverse urban environments. By focusing on real-time detection, this project seeks to contribute to the creation of safer public spaces, reduce accidents, and enhance overall urban mobility.
The project focused on pedestrian detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project involves loading and preprocessing datasets for training, testing, and validation. The CNN model is defined using TensorFlow Keras, comprising convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers. The model is compiled and trained on the pedestrian images, and its performance is evaluated. The trained model is then saved for future use. The background information emphasizes the advantages of CNNs in recognizing patterns in images, which is crucial for detecting pedestrians in various scenarios.
